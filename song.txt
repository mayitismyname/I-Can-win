Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now my ears are ringing
It's getting close

Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now the room is spinning
It's getting closer now

I've been waiting for the great leap forwards
I'm so impatient, yeah, I want to cut corners
I stare at the skyline
Reach for a lifeline
I shout into the great unknown

If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign!
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown

If there's anyone out there
Just give me a sign!
If there's anyone out there
I shout into the great unknown

Is this a new beginning?
Or are we close to the end?
Now the room is spinning
It's getting closer now

Oh, the beauty of the twilight glow
Oh, the delusion of Vincent Van Gogh
A red sky at night
A shepherd's flashlight
His beam sweeps like brushstrokes across the sky
